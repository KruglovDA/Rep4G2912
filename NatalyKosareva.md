# Welcome to Markdown! Wanna know how I did this?

Just put # in the beginning of the sentence, then leave a space, and then enter the text

#This is what happens when you don't leave a space between # and the text. Don't do that, you are not on Twitter

## This is a smaller head text. How did this happen?

Just put ## in the beginning, then leave a space, and enter your text

You should always leave a blank line between paragraphs

Otherwise it will look like this: Somebody once told me
The world is gonna roll me
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kind of dumb
With her finger and her thumb
In the shape of an "L" on her forehead

And this is what the text looks like with blank lines:

Somebody once told me

The world is gonna roll me

I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed

She was looking kind of dumb

With her finger and her thumb

In the shape of an "L" on her forehead

**Suppose you want to emphasize something with bold text**

Just put ** before the text you need to emphasize, enter the text without space and put ** in the end, also without a space

*You can also have italics in Markdown*

Put * before the text you need to italicize, enter the text without space and put * in the end, also without a space

Suppose you want to add a list of items in your text:

* a peach
* a pear 
* and a polar bear

Just put *, then hit the space and enter the text

***

If you write in *** and click Enter, you will get a horizontal line

***Your text can be both italicized and bold***

Write in ***, then the text without a space, and then *** again

> Books are good

To enter a quote, write in >, then a space, then the quote itself

$Look$ $what$ $I$ $found!$ $A$ $cute$ $font!$

You need to put $ before and after every single word you need to write with a cute font, without space

## This is the end!

This is a new branch - text_formatting

This is a third branch - lists



hello again

Change on text_formatting branch

To add non-numerated lists use *, a space and then the text

* Element 1

* Element 2

To add numerated lists you need to add a number and dot, then the text

1. Element 1

2. Element 2






Lists are great

Change on text_formatting branch

To make the text _italicized_ we can use _(without space) in front of and in the end of the text

_The text can be italicized **and bold** at the same time_

To add an image in the text you need to add 
![Head of Binnong](ifgrf.jpg)
